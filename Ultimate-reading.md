# ultimate speed reading

this book covers general techinques for reading. what I like about it is that it provided a number of examples for practicing your speed reading techniques. it focused on 3 main concepts of conceptualizing the matieral and then breaking it down into pictures. Each stop needs to have a mental picture to help it stick. the book also repeatedly made reasonable claims that trying to push speed alone will not work. the goal should br understanding first which means really fighting the urge to skip over things.
